# YouTube Trend Analysis
## **Description**
My project has three main menus.

-   First is the 'Storytelling' menu, where you can hear stories about different types of YouTube channels. It explains what 
makes some channels more popular and profitable than others. This menu is great for people thinking about starting their 
own channels because it gives them ideas on what works and what doesn't on YouTube.

-   Next up is the 'Explore Data' menu. Here, you can play around with the data and make your own graphs. It's like a 
playground where you can look at the information in different ways. You can focus on what interests you the most and see 
how things are connected.

-   Lastly, there's the 'Youtuber Suggestions' menu. It recommends famous YouTubers who are really good at getting people 
interested in their videos. By seeing what these successful YouTubers do, you can get ideas for your own channel. It's 
like having a mentor who shows you the ropes of YouTube success.
